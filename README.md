# Popform Assignment

This is a frontend-only application built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. It uses react-router-dom for routing, tailwindcss for styling

## Prerequisites

Please before you can run this application you will need to have the following installed

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```


3. Start the development server:

```

npm run dev

```

This will start the frontend development server (default: http://localhost:5173).

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to see the application running.

## Project Structure

1. /src: Contains all source code, including components, pages, and routes.
2. /src/components: Reusable components for the application.
3. /src/pages: Different screens or views for the app.
4. /src/router: Configuration for react-router-dom routes.
5. /src/layout: application layout.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- npm run dev: Starts the development server.
- npm run build: Builds the app for production.
- npm run preview: Previews the production build.

## Technologies Used

- React (with Vite for fast development)
- TypeScript: Type safety for JavaScript.
- Tailwind CSS: Utility-first styling.
- React Router DOM: Client-side routing for navigation.

## Key Notes

- Routing: The app uses react-router-dom for navigation across pages.
- State Management: State is managed with React hooks and contextAPI for persisting user interactions across screens.
- Styling: Tailwind CSS is used for efficient, utility-based styling.
 

## Important
This application runs in development mode by default. If you encounter any issues, try restarting the server with npm run dev.
